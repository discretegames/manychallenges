# [Many Challenges](https://github.com/discretegames/manychallenges)

A repository of various coding challenges completed by me (discretegames) in multiple programming languages
with the help of my [RunMany Python package](https://pypi.org/project/runmany/)
and accompanying [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=discretegames.runmany).

To run the solutions for yourself, ensure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/)
and [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.6+ or higher installed, then run the following commands:

```text
git clone https://github.com/discretegames/manychallenges.git
cd manychallenges

pip install runmany --upgrade
runmany project-euler/1.many
```

This will run [project-euler/1.many](https://github.com/discretegames/manychallenges/blob/main/ProjectEuler/1.many)
which solves [Project Euler challenge 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) in 15 different languages, each in 2 ways.

Open the .many files in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the
[RunMany extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=discretegames.runmany)
to easily run the solutions in an IDE with syntax highlighting.
